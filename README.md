#**📚 How It Works**

The password is checked against a set of rules like:

Minimum 8 characters

At least 1 uppercase letter (A-Z)

At least 1 lowercase letter (a-z)

At least 1 number (0-9)

At least 1 special character (e.g. !, @, #)

Each rule adds to the total strength score and determines the final label shown to the user.
